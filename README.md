# Wildlife-of-the-Plain
This project simulates interactions among different forms of life in a plain. 
The plain is represented by an 𝑁×𝑁 grid that changes over a number of cycles. Within a cycle, each square is occupied by one of the following five life forms: Badger (B), Fox (F), Rabbit (R), Grass (G), and Empty (E). An Empty square means that it is not occupied by any life form.
